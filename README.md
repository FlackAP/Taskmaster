TaskMaster

Using Parse, I was able to create a simple to-do list webapp. It seems my classmates may have had a bit of fun with 
the persistent data, so consider this a disclaimer if you're offended by to-do lists populated with tasks that center
around drinking a lot of beer.

As always, feel free to play around with the code as much as you'd like.
